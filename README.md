# DumbChess
A chess app for iOS with a dumb AI to make you feel good at chess. Beware -- it can be aggressive!

The chess AI, chessboard behavior, and gameplay behavior are all original work by me, @Malachi-Holden. The chess engine was constructed with no prior research into chess engine design, except for common knowledge/light wikipedia reading.

The AI is "dumb" because it was not built on the work of other chess engine designers, so it suffers from ineficiency. This project was a challenge to test my ability to reinvent the wheel. It is not intended to replace any popular chess apps.

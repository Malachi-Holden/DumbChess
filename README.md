# DumbChess
A chess app with a really dumb AI so you can feel really good at chess. Beware -- it can be aggressive!

The chess AI, chessboard behavior, and gameplay behavior are all original work by @Malachi-Holden

Chess piece graphics from [lichess](https://github.com/ornicar/lila/tree/master/public/piece/alpha)

Follows [this](https://www.scalablepath.com/blog/creating-ios-custom-views-uikit/) article for adding @IBDesignable custom views to my storyboard

Uses [Material Components](material.io) for UI
